    <h1>Pros and Cons</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Many people are drawn to the Bichon Frise breed of dog, because they are cute dogs with friendly personalities. However, it is important to know all of the pros and cons of having a Bichon before you commit to owning one.
        </br>许多人被比熊犬吸引，是因为它们性格友好又十分可爱。然而，在养一只比熊犬之前，了解它们的优缺点是十分重要的。</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Pros 优点：</br></b>
        1. An obvious plus to having a Bichon dog is that heir fluffy white fur and cute face makes them visually appealing. Their mannerisms, such as their tendency to tilt their head to the side while listening to you, also contribute to their cuteness. A Bichon Frise is also very playful and enjoys playing games like tug-of-war and fetching toys.
        养比熊犬的一个明显好处是，它们蓬松的白毛和圆圆的脸庞使它们看起来非常可爱。它们的行为举止，如在听你说话时将头歪向一边倾听，也为它们增添了一份可爱。比熊犬也很贪玩，喜欢玩拔河、捡玩具等游戏。比熊犬是非常友好的狗狗，它们喜欢有人常伴。
        </br>
        2. Bichons are really friendly dogs and they prefer to always have the company of people.
        During the day, a Bichon will often gravitate to the room of the house where people are sitting, or laying and look for a comfortable spot next to someone where they can snuggle.
        At night, Bichons are able to sleep on their own, but they always prefer sleeping with someone if they are allowed.
        白天，比熊犬经常会待在主人的周围，靠在或躺在主人身边，寻找一个舒适的位置，和主人依偎在一起。到了晚上，比熊犬可以自己睡觉，但如果得到主人允许，它们总是更喜欢和人一起睡。
        </br>
        3. A Bichon Frise dog is very patient and makes a great companion for children and older people alike. Bichons don’t shed and are hypoallergenic. This makes them a great option for people who have wanted a dog, but have avoided getting one due to allergies. Since they don’t shed, there’s no need to worry about cleaning dog hair off your clothes and furniture. This is a huge benefit compared to most other dog breeds. 
        比熊犬非常有耐心，是儿童和老年人的好伙伴。比熊犬不掉毛，而且过敏性低。这使得它们成为那些想要养狗，但由于过敏而未养狗的人的最佳选择。由于它们不掉毛，主人不需要担心清理衣服和家具上的狗毛。与大多数其他犬种相比，这是一个巨大的好处。
        </br>
        4. The Bichon breed is also really intelligent and understands a lot more than most dog breeds. They can be taught tricks fairly easily, and they often understand what is going on based on observing behavior around them. Keep in mind that Bichons prefer positive affirmation while being trained, and they will often retreat if they are scolded. The Bichon Frise is not a loud dog, nor a yappy dog that barks a lot.
        比熊犬种也非常聪明，比大多数狗狗的理解力强得多。教它们玩小把戏相当容易，而且它们总是能够通过观察周围人行为动作来理解别人的意思。请记住，比熊犬在接受训练时需要得到积极的肯定，如果被责骂，它们往往会退缩。比熊犬的叫声不大，也不是总喜欢狂吠的犬种。
        </br>
        5. Since it's a small dog that requires relatively little exercise, a Bichon is perfect for those who live in apartments or don’t have a huge yard. Bichon Frise dogs generally have a long lifespan and can live up to 17 years of age. Many larger breeds have life expectancies of less than 10 years, so the longer lifespan of a Bichon dog can be a big benefit if you’re wanting a long-term companion.
        由于它是一种小型犬，需要的运动量相对较小，所以比熊犬非常适合那些住在公寓或没有大院子的人。比熊犬的寿命一般较长，可以活到17岁。许多大型犬种的寿命还不到10年，因此，如果您想要一个长期的宠物伴侣，那么寿命较长的比熊犬会是一个很好的选择。
        </br>
        6. This small dog doesn't require much exercise. Because of this, a Bichon Frise is very appealing to more elderly owners or those who aren’t the most active. This doesn’t mean they don’t need to get out and about. They do still like going for walks and playing with toys.
        这种小型犬不需要太多的锻炼。正因如此，比熊犬对于老人或那些不方便运动的人来说非常有吸引力。当然，这并不意味着它们不需要外出活动。他们仍然喜欢散步和玩玩具。

        <b>Although there are many pros to having a Bichon Frise dog, the cons are also important to note.
        </br>虽然比熊犬有许多优点，我们仍要注意它们的缺点。</b>
    </p>
        
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Cons缺点:</br></b>
        <b>1. Housebreaking:
        拆家：</br></b>
        Probably the most common problem with Bichons is difficulty in housebreaking. In fact, this is likely the biggest reason why so many Bichons end up in shelters. Consistency and patience are required when dealing with Bichons. Just know that the house-training process may take longer than it would for other dog breeds.
        比熊最常见的问题可能就是拆家了。实际上，这可能是许多比熊犬最终被送到收容所的最大原因。在饲养比熊犬时，坚持与耐心是十分重要的。要知道，训练比熊不拆家的过程可能比训练其他犬种的时间要长。
        </br>
        <b>2. Keeping them looking good:
        让它们保持良好的形象：</br></b>
        Another difficulty with Bichons is the same thing that makes them so cute: their fluffy white fur. The problem is that it takes a lot of work to keep their fur looking so good. Matted hair is common in a Bichon dog, so frequent brushing is required. Grooming is suggested every 6 weeks or so, which can be costly. Cleaning their tear stains is also something that can be inconvenient to Bichon Frise owners. Their white fur gets really stained near their eyes, and that area must be cleaned frequently.
        另一个缺点正是它们如此可爱的原因：它们蓬松的白毛。问题是，要保持它们的毛发美观很费功夫。比熊犬的毛发经常纠缠打结，因此需要经常梳理。建议每6周左右进行一次梳洗，这可能会很费钱。清洁泪痕也给比熊犬主人带来诸多不便。它们的白毛在靠近眼睛的地方会有深红色的泪痕，因此，主人需要每天为小狗清理眼睛。
        </br>
        <b>3. Separation Anxiety:
        分离焦虑：</br></b>
        The friendliness of Bichons can also sometimes be a problem because they don’t like to be left alone. Separation anxiety can be a real issue for them. They definitely prefer having an owner who has plenty of time to spend with them.
        比熊犬的友善有时也是一个问题，因为它们不愿被单独留下。分离焦虑对比熊犬来说是一个严重的问题。它们绝对希望有一位时间充裕，能够一直陪着它们的主人。
         </br>
        <b>4. Various Health Issues:
        各种健康问题：</br></b>
        Lastly, Bichons are prone to various health issues. They often have skin problems, can have serious reactions to fleas, and may have a lot of itching during dry weather. They are also prone to other health issues, such as bladder stones, that can lead to many veterinarian visits.
        最后，比熊犬很容易出现各种健康问题。它们经常有皮肤问题，对跳蚤严重过敏，在干燥的天气里总是皮肤瘙痒。它们还容易出现其他健康问题，如膀胱结石，因此，比熊的主人可能要经常带它们去看宠物医生。 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Tip: </b>
        </br>
        Health issues can often be avoided by choosing a reputable breeder, so take the time to do some research prior to purchasing a Bichon Frise.
        </br>
        小贴士：选择有经验的饲养员可以避免大多数健康问题，所以在购买比熊犬之前，请多花时间了解一下它们。
