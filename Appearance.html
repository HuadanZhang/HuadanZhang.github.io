    <h1>Appearance</h1>
    <p>Take one look at a purebred Bichon Frise and you'll fall in love, instantly. Bichons can be anywhere from 12-18 pounds and stand between 9.5-11.5 inches tall. Their coat is always white, their eyes and noses black.
        While there is actually no such thing as a hypoallergenic dog, the low-shedding coat and drool-free tendencies of a Bichon Frise might make her a good fit for those who tend to sniffle and sneeze around pups. </p>
    <p>But take note: Even though she's low-shedding, her double coat can be high maintenance when it comes to grooming. The outer coat stands away from the body, giving her that signature cotton ball appearance.</p>
